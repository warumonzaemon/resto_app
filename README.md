# Uplift Project 5 - Hepa Lane

An online food ordering app based on the food stalls in university belt in Manila.
Although for it is only for comic relief, it was called Hepa Lane because sauce dips that everybody use may contain contagious disease.

Later this app was integrated with backend development.
